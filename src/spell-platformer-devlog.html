		<p class="heading">Spell Puzzle Platformer.</p>
		<p>I started by making a project and setting up a state machine for player movement.</p>

		<p>The fundamental concept is "Draw glyphs > Get effect based on glyph"<br>
To do this, I created a spellcast scene which, when the player is in the cast state, will append the mouse's position to a list every frame it is clicked.<br><br>

When the mouse is released, cast is exited, which calls the cast() function in the spellcast scene.<br>
cast() takes the list of mouse positions, and runs a function called simplify(), which is an implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm.<br><br>

It then takes the decimated curve and runs it into curve_to_anglesig(), which constructs a list of floats representing the global angles (in degrees) between each point.<br><br>

It then runs anglesig_match(angles) to match the angles to the spell (which are all defined in a JSON file which is loaded as an array).<br><br></p>

		</div>
		<p>I then added a casting_table scene, and set it up so that if the player was not overlapping with it, the cast state could not be entered.<br><br>

		I finally created a cylinder scene, which contains an array for spells to cast to, and performs the correct spell's effect (so far just printing their names) when f is pressed.<br><br>

		I took a break from here until Monday, because I didn't know how to make UI (I made a garbage version which used global_position though).<br><br></p>
